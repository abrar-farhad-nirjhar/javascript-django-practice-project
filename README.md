# javascript-django-practice-project

This is a simple todolist webapplication

NOTE: NO USER AUTHENTICATION WAS USED

A simple api was created using the Django REST Framework

And for the front end, HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript

This was just for practice.

Python Version: 3.6.3

Django Version: 2.1.0

Django Requirements: rest_framework, corsheaders

For CSS: 
Two files, index.css, and the semantic-ui CDN

Three separate JavaScript files:

main.js This was used to write the main logic

api.js This was used to call the apis, GET, POST, DELETE // FOR NOW. I MIGHT ADD MORE LATER

ui.js This was used to generate the todo list table
